    "## Python Tutorial: break, continue, and pass Statements\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the break, continue, and pass statements are used to control the flow of loops or conditionals. These statements allow you to manipulate the execution of loops, making them essential for controlling how your programs run.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: The break Statement\n",
    "The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely. When Python encounters a break statement inside a loop (like a for or while loop), it immediately stops the loop, and the program continues with the first statement after the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Using break in a while Loop"
